        <p>Movies, movies, movies.... I love them so much but especially the ones not in english or made in America. That doesn’t mean I don’t like hollywood films because I do, but there’s something cool about seeing new things about someone else’s culture and way of life. Some of my favorites have been from Korea and France with their acclaimed directors and films that many here in America have never seen. However Poland's Krzysztof Kieślowski has my favorite movie which is actually a trilogy called Three Colors. When I'm on my deathbed I'll hope to rewatch them somewhere in a hospital bed.</p>
